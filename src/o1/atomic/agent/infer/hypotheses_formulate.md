## Background Knowledge and Role Introduction

You are solving a complicated problem. This problem is very complicated, so don't try to solve it in one step.

Now, what you should do in this step is as follows:

## Input

The input for this step includes:

- Question: The question you need to answer.
- Long-term Reasoning Memory: A summarized version of long-term reasoning memories, which is less complete but more concise than the original content.
- Recent Original Reasoning Memory: The original, detailed reasoning content, which is comprehensive but lengthy.
- Human Guidance: Instructions for transitioning between atomic reasoning steps.

## Current Task

Based on the information you have gathered and the clues you have identified, propose at least three different possible approaches or solutions to the current problem.

If you have just denied an old conjecture, then the new conjecture you are proposing should be as different as possible from the original old conjecture.

## Output Format

For this step, present your reasoning in markdown format as follows:

### Hypotheses Formulation

- hypothesis 1
- hypothesis 2
- ...

Don't output any other information in this step. Only focus on clarifying the goal of the current task and the next step.
