### Background Knowledge and Role Introduction

You are solving a complicated problem. This problem is very complicated, so don't try to solve it in one step.

Now, what you should do in this step is as follows:

### Input

The input for this step includes:

- Question: The question you need to answer.
- Long-term Reasoning Memory: A summarized version of long-term reasoning memories, which is less complete but more concise than the original content.
- Recent Original Reasoning Memory: The original, detailed reasoning content, which is comprehensive but lengthy.
- Human Guidance: Instructions for transitioning between atomic reasoning steps.

### Current Task

You need to first dig deeper into the existing information to uncover some deeper information, and then reason. The answer to this problem may be hidden in these deeper information.

1. First, select one or more pieces of highly relevant information from the existing data.
   - You should give a reason for selecting the information.
   - The chosen information should be from the information organized in the previous Information Collection step, and you should use the original wording as much as possible.
2. Think about the type of information selected (image, number, table, string, etc.) and consider when observing this type of information, what aspects humans usually focus on.
3. Based on the previous observations, observe the selected information from different perspectives.
   - Note that you need to observe carefully step by step to ensure that the observed information is correct.
   - Do not analyze anything at this stage.
4. Extract insights from the information you have observed.

### Output Format

For this step, present your insights in markdown format as follows:

#### Insight Extraction

##### 1. Chosen Information

- Reason for Selection
- Relevant Information 1
- Relevant Information 2

##### 2. Think

- Type of Information
- Aspects of Information Humans Focus On

##### 3. Observations:

Let's observe step by step, ...(maybe very detailed)

##### 4. Insights: ...

Focus solely on extracting and analyzing insights from the information provided, without adding any additional commentary.
