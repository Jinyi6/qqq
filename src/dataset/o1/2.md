Let $n$ be an even positive integer. Let $p$ be a monic, real polynomial of degree $2n$; that is to say,

$$p(x) = x^{2n} + a_{2n-1}x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$$

for some real coefficients  $a_0, \cdots, a_{2n-1}$. Suppose that $p(\frac{1}{k}) = k^2$ for all integers $k$ such that $1 \leq \lvert k \rvert \leq n$.

Find all other real numbers $x$ for which $p(\frac{1}{x}) = x^2$.
